        # Ghost Blog (under /blog probably? or root? The guide says / so maybe conflicting with admin on root?)
        # Guide says:
        # Admin Panel: http://localhost:3000 -> mapped to / (so port 80 / goes to admin?)
        # Frontend: http://localhost -> mapped to ghost? 
        # Quick Start says:
        # Frontend Publico: http://localhost -> Homepage with mock articles
        # Admin Panel: http://localhost:3000
        # So on port 80 (nginx), / should probably go to Ghost (Public Frontend).
        # And Admin Panel is accessed via port 3000 (or 5173 direct) or mapped to /admin-panel?
        
        # Let's follow the production map:
        # oInvestigador.pt -> Ghost
        # admin.oInvestigador.pt -> Admin Panel
        # api.oInvestigador.pt -> API
        
        # In Dev, usually we access ports directly.
        # But if we use Nginx on 80...
        # Let's map localhost to Ghost (Frontend).
        
        # Redefining location / to Ghost
    }
}

# Re-doing the server block for dev to match production domains simulation or just ports.
# Since dev environment usually accesses ports directly:
# Ghost: 2368
# API: 3001
# Admin: 5173
# Nginx on 80/443 is mostly for testing proxy or production simulation.
# Let's make localhost:80 serve Ghost (Public).
